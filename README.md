### Background and Overview

Inspired by the application Feedly, Feedme is a personalized news and media aggregator clone that gives users easy access to their favorite news articles and sources all in one place. Create a feed for your specific interest (i.e., technology, important people, sports, etc.), customize it by adding all your relevant sources, and navigate through all of its articles with a friendly feed interface and a couple clicks of a button.


## Technologies and Challenges

### Technologies Used

Feedme is built with a Rails backend, React/Redux frontend, and a customized database using PostgreSQL. RESTful API routes used. Some notable libraries used are Jbuidler, BCrypt, and SecureRandom. Jbduilder is used to render JSON data from backend to frontend, whereas BCcrypt and SecureRandom are used to hash passwords and generate session tokens, respectively, for user user authentication.
