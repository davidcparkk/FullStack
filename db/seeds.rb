The deal is Airbnb’s largest M&A transaction yet, and will accelerate the home-sharing giant’s growth as it gears up for an initial public offering.
  Airbnb reportedly began talks to acquire HotelTonight months ago, and finally confirmed its intent to acquire the business in early March. Reports indicated a price tag of more than $400 million; Airbnb declined to comment on the size of the deal.
  As part of the deal, HotelTonight co-founder and chief executive officer Sam Shank  will lead the boutique hotel category at Airbnb, one of the company’s newer units meant to help it scale beyond treehouses and quirky homes.
  “When we founded HotelTonight, we sought to reimagine the hotel booking experience to be more simple, fast and fun, and to better connect travelers with the world’s best boutique and independent hotels,” Shank said in a statement. “We are delighted to take this vision to new heights as part of Airbnb.”
  Shank launched the San Francisco-based company in 2010. Most recently, it was valued at $463 million with a $37 million Series E funding in 2017, according to PitchBook. HotelTonight raised a total of $131 million in equity funding from venture capital firms including Accel, Battery Ventures, Forerunner Ventures and First Round Capital.", source_id: s1.id, image_url: "/assets/hotelbnb.jpg", url: "https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/airbnb-officially-owns-hoteltonight/", author: "Kate Clark" )

  a2 = Article.create!(title: "Juul Launches Pilot Program That Tracks How Juul Devices Get in the Hands of Minors", body:"Juul Labs is today launching a pilot for its new Track & Trace program, which is meant to use data to identify exactly how Juul devices wind up in the hands of minors.
  Juul vaporizers all have a serial number down at the bottom, by the Juul logo. However, it wasn’t until recently that Juul had the capability to track those serial numbers through every step of the process, from manufacture to distribution to retail to sale.
  With Track & Trace, Juul is calling upon parents, teachers and law enforcement officials to come to the Juul Report web portal when they confiscate a device from a minor and input the serial number. Each time a device is input in the Track & Trace system, Juul will open an investigation to understand how that minor wound up with that device.
  In some cases, it may be an issue with a certain retail store knowingly selling to minors. In others, it may be a case of social sourcing, where someone over 21 years of age buys several devices and pods to then sell to minors.
  Juul will then take next steps in investigating, such as talking to a store manager about the issue. It may also enhance its secret shopper program around a certain store or distributor where it sees there may be a spike in sale/distribution, to youth to identify the source of the problem. To be clear, Track & Trace only tracks and traces the devices themselves, and does not use personal data about customers.
  Juul isn’t yet widely publicizing Track & Trace (thus, the “Pilot” status), but it is focusing on Houston as a testing ground with banner ads targeted at older individuals (parents, teachers, etc.) pointing them to the portal. Of note: The ad campaign is geofenced to never be shown in or around a school, hopefully keeping the program a secret from young people illegally using Juul.
  The company wants to learn more about how people use the portal and test the program in action before widening the campaign around Track & Trace. That said, the Report portal is not limited to Houston residents — anyone who confiscates a Juul can report it through the portal and trigger an investigation.
  “It’s important to note that the pilot is an opportunity for us to learn how the technology is working and optimize the technology,” said Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould. “It’s not just at the retailer level. It’s a whole process through the supply chain to track that device and find out if everyone who is supposed to be scanning it is scanning it, and the software that we’ve created to track that serial number through the supply chain to the retail store is working. The only way we’re going to know that is when someone puts in the serial number and we see if we have all the data we need to track it.”
  According to Juul, every device in production will be trackable in the next few weeks. In other words, Juul vapes that are years old are likely not fully traceable in the program, but those purchased more recently should work with the system.
  Juul has been under scrutiny from the FDA and a collection of Democratic Senators due to the device’s rise in popularity among young people. Outgoing FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has called it “an epidemic” and enforced further restrictions on sales of e-cig products.
  Juul has also made its own effort, removing non-tobacco and non-menthol flavored pods from all physical retail stores, enhancing their own purchasing system online to ensure online buyers are 21+ and not buying in bulk, going after counterfeits and copycats posing as Juul products and exiting its Facebook and Instagram accounts.
  But Juul Labs also committed to build technology-based solutions to prevent youth use of the product. Co-founder and CPO James Monsees told TechCrunch at Disrupt SF that the company is working on Bluetooth products that would essentially make the Juul device as smart as an iPhone or Android device, which could certainly help lock out folks under 21.
  However, the Track & Trace program is the first real technological step taken by the e-cig company. And it has been an expensive one. The company has spent more than $30 million to update its packaging, adjust printing standards, change manufacturing equipment and integrate the data and logistics software systems.
  For now, Track & Trace is only applicable to Juul vaporizers, but it wouldn’t be shocking to learn that the company was working on a similar program for its Juul Pods.", source_id: s1.id, image_url: "/assets/juul.jpeg", url: "https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/juul-launches-a-pilot-program-that-tracks-how-juul-devices-get-in-the-hands-of-minors/", author:"Jordan Crook" )

  An alert was published Friday by the government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency following a public disclosureby CERT/CC, the vulnerability disclosure center at Carnegie Mellon University.
  The VPN apps built by four vendors — Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Pulse Secure and F5 Networks — improperly store authentication tokens and session cookies on a user’s computer. These aren’t your traditional consumer VPN apps used to protect your privacy, but enterprise VPN apps that are typically rolled out by a company’s IT staff to allow remote workers to access resources on a company’s network.
  The apps generate tokens from a user’s password and are stored on their computer to keep the user logged in without having to reenter their password every time. But if stolen, these tokens can allow access to that user’s account without needing their password.
  But with access to a user’s computer — such as through malware — an attacker could steal those tokens and use them to gain access to a company’s network with the same level of access as the user. That includes company apps, systems and data.
  So far, only Palo Alto Networks has confirmed its GlobalProtect app was vulnerable. The company issued a patch for both its Windows and Mac clients.
  Neither Cisco nor Pulse Secure have patched their apps. F5 Networks is said to have known about storing since at least 2013 but advised users to roll out two-factor authentication instead of releasing a patch.

  a5 = Article.create!(title: "House approves Save the Internet Act that would reinstate net neutrality", body:"On Wednesday, the House of Representatives successfully pushed through a measure that would reinstate the same net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal in 2017.
  The Save the Internet Act was approved 232-190 Wednesday afternoon after months of debate and committee hearings in the House. The measure was introduced last month in both chambers by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) with plenty of fanfare from consumer advocacy groups and the American electorate. The bill, if approved, would restore the net neutrality rules put in place by way of the Obama-era FCC’s Open Internet Order in 2015 that were repealed under a Republican majority only two years later.
  “DEMOCRATS ARE HONORING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE”
  “With the Save the Internet Act, Democrats are honoring the will of the people,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said last month.
  The measure would once again make it unlawful for internet service providers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile to block or throttle consumer access to the internet and empower the FCC as the main authority to enforce those rules by way of Title II of the Communications Act. The Title I and Title II distinctions for the internet have been the main point of contention among Republicans and Democrats for years, and this same partisan debate reared its head once again when Democrats announced that they were planning to codify these rules into law earlier this year.
  When internet providers are classified as Title II common carriers rather than a Title I communications services, they’re held to a higher regulatory standard similar to telephone, gas, and electric services. It also ensures that the FCC is able to enforce these rules and punish providers that are caught engaging in behaviors that would be unlawful under the Save the Internet Act.
  Over the past few months, Republicans have proposed their own net neutrality measures, most of which would outlaw blocking and throttling but wouldn’t reinstate the Title II provisions. “Republicans have put forth serious proposals — a menu of options — that would keep the Internet open and free, so it can continue to be a driver of opportunity for all,” Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) said on the House floor yesterday.
  “WHAT MY FRIEND CALLS A TAKEOVER OF THE INTERNET, WE CALL PROTECTING CONSUMERS.”
  Democrats have rebuked these conservative measures, arguing that, without the Title II distinction, there would be “no cop on the beat” to enforce those bright-line rules.
  “What my friend [Walden] calls a takeover of the internet, we call protecting consumers,” Doyle said.
  Despite widespread bipartisan support among the Republican and Democrat electorate, the Save the Internet Act might be on its last leg, even after a similar measure was approved in the Senate last year. Shortly after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality under Chairman Ajit Pai, the Senate voted 52–47 to approve a Congressional Review Act (CRA) measure that would reverse the commission’s 2017 decision to repeal net neutrality. In order to approve a CRA measure, the Senate only needs a simple majority, but the Save the Internet Act would require a supermajority, or 60 votes, which Democrats just don’t have.
  The CRA ultimately failed in the Republican-controlled House last year, and since too much time has passed since the 2017 repeal, a CRA measure cannot be called up again.
  Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters that the net neutrality measure would be “dead on arrival” once it’s sent over from the House of Representatives. The White House also put out a statement on Monday threatening to veto the bill if it somehow finds approval in the Senate. If the bill “were presented to the President,” the statement said, “his advisors would recommend that he veto it.”
  “It will not become law,” Walden, ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said on the House floor on Tuesday. “This is the end of its journey.”", source_id: s1.id, image_url: "", url: "https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval", author:"Makena Kelly" )

The artificial intelligence that makes this possible has matured significantly in recent years and in some applications is very proficient, but in other ways, still has a long way to go.
  AI Recognizes What an Image Is
  It’s taken two decades for computer scientists to train and develop machines that can “see” the world around them—another example of an everyday skill humans take for granted yet one that is quite challenging to train a machine to do.
  Facial recognition technology, used both in retail and security, is one way AI and its ability to “see” the world is starting to be commonplace. Retailers use facial recognition technology to better market and sell to their target audience. In one particularly intriguing use case, some Chinese office complexes have vending machines that identify shoppers through facial recognition technology and track the items they take from the machine to ultimately bill the shoppers' accounts. Even anonymous data about shoppers collected from cameras such as age, gender, and body language can help retailers improve their marketing efforts and provide a better customer experience.
  Retail giant Walmart deployed a fleet of stock-monitoring robots that can identify through computer vision when a shelf needs more product and alert humans to ensure it happens. Target is also testing out similar technology.

  a7 = Article.create!(title: "10 Tips for Creating Landing Pages That Convert the Most Prospects", body:"The following excerpt is from Robert W. Bly’s book The Direct Mail Revolution: How to Create Profitable Direct Mail Campaigns in a Digital World. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | Apple Books | IndieBound
  Here are a few suggestions for sharpening up your landing page content to increase conversion rates:
  1. Build credibility early
  People have always been skeptical of advertising, and with the proliferation of spam and shady operators, they’re even more skeptical of what they read online. Therefore, your landing-page copy must immediately overcome that skepticism.
  One way to do that is to make sure you clearly display one or more credibility builderson the first screen visitors see. In the banner at the top of the page, use your logo and company name. Within or immediately under the banner, put a strong testimonial or three above the headline on the first screen. Consider adding a prehead or subhead that summarizes your company’s mission statement or credentials.
  2. Capture the email addresses of nonbuyers
  There are a number of ways to capture the email addresses of visitors who come to your landing page but don’t buy the product. One is to use a window offering a free report or online course in exchange for their email address. This window can be served to the visitor as a pop-up (it appears when the visitor arrives at the landing page) or a pop-under (a window that appears when the visitor attempts to leave the landing page without making an inquiry or purchase).
  The problem with pop-ups and pop-unders is that if the user has a pop-up blocker installed on their browser, they won’t ever see them. The solution is to use a floater—a window that slides onto the screen from the side or top. The floater is part of the website HTML code, so it’s not stopped by the pop-up blocker.

  3. Use lots of testimonials
  Testimonials build credibility and overcome skepticism. If you invite customers to a live event, ask if they’d be willing to give you a brief testimonial on video. Have a professional videographer tape it, get a signed release from the customer, and post the testimonial on your landing page as streaming video.
  For written testimonials, customers may suggest that you write what you want them to say and just run it by them for approval. Politely ask that they give you their opinion of your product in their own words. What they come up with will likely be more specific, believable, and detailed than your version.
  4. Use lots of bullets
  Highlight key features and benefits in a list of short, easy-to-read bulleted items. I often use a format where the first part of the bullet is the feature and after a dash comes the benefit. For example: “Quick-release adhesive system -- your graphics stay clean and don’t stick together.”
  Online buyers like to think they’re getting a lot for their money, so when you’re selling a product directly from your landing page, be sure you cover all major features and important benefits in a comprehensive bullet list on the page. When generating leads by giving away white papers, use bullets to describe the contents of the paper and the benefits that information delivers can raise conversion rates for download requests.
  5. Arouse curiosity in the headline
  The headline should either arouse curiosity, make a powerful promise, or otherwise grab the reader’s attention so they have no choice but to keep reading. The headline for a landing page selling a training program on how to become a professional property locator made a big promise: “Become a Property Locator Today --and Make $100,000 a Year in the Greatest Real Estate Career That Only a Few Insiders Know About.”
  6. Use a conversational copy style
  Most corporate websites are unemotional and sterile, offering just “information.” But a landing page is a letter from one human being to another. Make it sound that way. Even if your product is highly technical and you’re selling it to techies, remember that they’re still human and you can’t sell something by boring people to death.

  7. Incorporate an emotional hook in the lead paragraph and headline
  Logical selling can work, but tapping into the prospect’s emotions is much stronger, especially when you correctly assess how the prospect feels about your product or the problem he needs solved.
  8. Solve the reader’s problem
  Once you hook the reader with emotional copy dramatizing their problem or a powerful free offer, show how your product or free information can help solve that problem. For example: “Now there’s a better, easier, and more effective solution to wobbly restaurant tables that can irritate customers and ruin their dining experience: Table Shox, the world’s smallest shock absorber.”
  9. Make it timely and current
  The more your online copy ties in with current events and news, the higher your response rates will be. This is especially critical when selling financial and investment information as well as regulatory compliance products in fields where laws and rules change frequently. Periodically update your landing page copy to reflect current business and economic conditions, challenges, and trends. This shows that your company’s on top of what’s happening in your industry.
  10. Stress the money-back guarantee or lack of user commitment
  If you allow customers to order products directly from the landing page, make sure you clearly state a money-back guarantee on that page. Your competitors probably offer strong money-back guarantees, so you must do the same. If your product is good and your copy accurate, your refund rates can be as low as 1 percent or less. If you’re generating leads, stress that your offer -- whether a white paper, online demonstration, or webinar -- is free. Say there is no obligation to buy and no salesperson will visit.", source_id: s2.id, image_url: "/assets/landing_pages.jpeg", url: "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/326374", author:"Robert Bly")

    a8 = Article.create!(title: "How to Run an Effective Conference: The 7 Steps You Need to Follow", body:"Running a conference can be a massive undertaking. And, the bigger the event, the more variables there will be to address, be mindful of and plan for.
    But we can’t overlook the many benefits of holding an event for your target audience, whether that means giving its members a chance to experience your business in a new way, building stronger partnerships with your vendors and suppliers or generating additional revenue.
    Related: 4 Ways to Organize a Conference That's More Than Just Networking
    Based on my experience running LTV Conf, a 300-plus person conference for SaaS business owners, investors and executives, I've learned that running an effective conference is an art and a science. Here are the key steps needed to ensure your event connects with your audience.
    1. Work out the key details in advance.
    It’s important to set yourself up for success. So, while the temptation might be to gloss over the finer details of running a conference, you have to take the time to think ahead about how it’s all going to come together -- or your event could end up a disaster. Start by considering:
    What are your goals for your event? What do you hope to achieve?
    Who is this event for? Why will these people attend?
    When and where will the event take place? What should a ticket cost?
    How much will the event cost? What is your budget?
    Who is going to speak at your event? How will the schedule be organized?
    At the start, your answers to these questions can be broad strokes. What matters is that as you begin to consider the answers, the details you still have to consider will present themselves, whether that means details for catering, additional seating or lodging for out-of-towners.
    Related: Changing the Faces We See at Conferences Starts With Organizers. Here Are 5 Tips to Change the Status Quo.
    2. Determine what your value proposition is.
    As with any product or service, you must be clear on what your guests will walk away with after attending your conference. And, depending on who your target audience is, that’s going to vary.
    Common elements to consider here include networking opportunities, tips and advice shared from the stage or in work sessions -- even the entertainment offered. MicroConf is a great example of a conference that created two versions of the event, geared toward two different entrepreneurial levels and two different regions of the world.
    Organizers also built in networking-happy hour events to ensure attendees could connect with one another, which helped the conference grow into one of the strongest communities in the SaaS industry. This was a direct result of the conference organizers' knowing who their audience was, and is.
    3. Choose the perfect venue.
    Your venue can make or break the event. That may at first seem like an overstatement, until you consider all relevant factors. A great venue should offer a hallway area in which attendees can network during the breaks, as well as be a relatively private area for the event as a whole.
    Convene is a great example of a venue designed for exactly this purpose, and the venue's professional staff can help you build the small details into your conference day that will make a difference (hint: Food and snacks matter more than might you think).
    Consider, too, whether there are hotels or restaurants nearby. Many conferences even hold their event in a hotel to allow guests to more easily connect and network after a long day of learning. Removing the barriers to intra-event gatherings is one of the best ways to ensure that your attendees enjoy themselves, build relationships -- and ultimately come back.
    4. Decide the best time to hold your event.
    Give yourself plenty of time to plan in advance for your event. If you have too tight of a deadline, many things  could fall through the cracks. Additionally, you'll want to do some research and uncover any competing events occurring. Another benefit of deciding your event in advance advance is giving your potential audience plenty of notice.
    Although the most important events to be aware of are those taking place in the same city, also consider larger events happening on a global scale that might compete with yours. Further, be aware of any major sporting events, music festivals and concerts, exhibits and the like.
    It’s worth thinking about the season of the year, too. When is the most popular time for conferences for your niche? Attendees are likely to build a conference schedule around the biggest events in your space, so make sure to research events lists to determine the optimal time to hold yours.
    5. Set your budget.
    Taking all considerations into account, how much will your event cost? Assess the pertinent areas, including the venue, speakers, entertainers, catering, staffing and the like. Tools like Demand Metric’s conference budget template can be really helpful in laying out exactly what the event is going to cost.
    Many organizations put on events that initially don’t net revenue at all in the short term, but do result in long-term sales because of the awareness, authority and credibility built through the audience targeted. Just be sure you decide what you are hoping to gain from your event.
    6. Choose your speakers carefully.
    Depending on the size and nature of your event, you can also put the call out for speakers and have them apply to win a spot on your roster. Just keep in mind that ticket sales could hinge on who will be coming to share, which means your list should be at least partially curated.
    Naturally, there are speakers and presenters in your industry that are more credible, authoritative, notorious, popular or something else. Consider what prominent experts you could bring in based on their availability and your budget. At LTV Conf, for example, we made sure to bring in a range of speakers who were experts in different facets, to offer attendees a variety of available knowledge categories. Celebrity speakers can also be worthwhile if you have the budget for it.
    The availability of speakers is another reason to leave plenty of planning time. Not all speakers will be available when you want them. And, it’s always good to be thinking about plan B and even plan C if your dream team doesn’t come together.
    7. Find attendees on Facebook.
    Marketing will play a critical role in the success of your event. When it comes to promoting your event and encouraging engagement, be sure to prioritize social media.
    Facebook groups are especially valuable for this task. You can create an event, invite prospects and continue to share information on the event as the date approaches. You can also see how your competitors set up their event, who RSVP’d, determine how to position your event and more.
    Final thoughts
    With all the i’s dotted and t’s crossed, you’re ready to run an effective conference. Be sure to give it the attention it deserves, as the bar for summits is high, and your audience members will not stay engaged if they aren’t being served.

    Desislava Dobreva is known as the “Branding Queen.” With a social media presence of over 100,000 engaged fans, a wait list for her courses and services, and experience helping entrepreneurs scale their businesses, she’s landed high-end clients consistently. 
    She says branding is the most underrated way to attract the right people, at the right time. She says that a lot of business owners hold the idea that branding is unnecessary or something they don't need to focus on just yet, but the truth is, branding is the best long-term strategy you can have.
    Don't try to attract everyone, because you can’t. Going deep in a “niche,” laser-focuses your marketing and lead generation. You can speak to a focused audience about solving their specific pain points. You can speak directly to those high-end clients and address their biggest problems. That gets their attention. 
    Get more clarity with your branding and messaging. Hire professionals if you have to. High-end clients and large companies work with entrepreneurs and businesses that have specific messaging, a strong foundation and clear expertise that addresses a practical solution to their issues.

    2. Market to human behavior. 
    Katya Varbanova is an expert in the study of human personal typing. She also has a large social media following and is the CEO of 20K Nation. She helps entrepreneurs create $20,000 in revenue a month consistently and then scale to seven-figures and beyond.
    She says one of the biggest discoveries that she’s consistently used in her marketing has been the science of human nature (or personality typing). She (and the data) contends that every single buyer on the planet has a specific personality type with specific most compatible types that they are most likely to say YES to.
    The secret sauce that has led to explosive growth in her business is diving deeper into personality types and how her business can help the most compatible types to her.
    Doing these studies helps entrepreneurs identify high-end clients and address their biggest insecurities. An entrepreneur can then use that information strategically to attract high-end clients that are compatible personality types. They're most likely to say YES to your offers.
    Create content that will resonate only with the highest compatibility people. Attract them and speak to them in a way they understand. Study the human behavior patterns and personality types of high-end clients in your niche. It can be a game changer.

    3. Develop a CEO mindset.
    High-end clients are attracted to fellow leaders and entrepreneurs who understand the CEO mindset. They want to hire someone that owns and manages a business, not someone that’s built a business that operates like their job.
    The CEO mindset means you hire the right team, contractors, and partners long before you hit a point of growing pains. You want to build your business based off of where you’re going, not where you are now. Putting measures in place to smoothly handle growth.
    When you have the CEO mindset, you put out a different vibe and energy. High-end clients, and customers in general, pick up on what your body language and words are putting out. If you’re desperate for business, the potential client can sense that and it’s likely to repel them. High-end clients especially want to do business with successful entrepreneurs.
    Be the boss. Act like the boss. Put out a boss vibe. Don’t “fake it until you make it.” Just make it and let potential customers see that you've leveled up your mindset.
    Your business deserves high-end clients and booking them consistently. The good news is that you can make that your reality. Use these three strategy shifts to attract larger deals and clients that show up ready to do business.", source_id: s2.id, image_url: "/assets/high-ticket.jpeg", url: "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331795", author:"Kimanzi Constable")

Search engine marketing (SEM), Facebook ads, search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing (SMM), blogging -- the options are many.
    Are you supposed to do all of them? Should you even try some of them? If so, which ones are most important? I know it’s so confusing. But there’s good news: I’ll answer those questions. In fact, I’ll give you practical answers that have worked for A-list bloggers. In other words, everything is about to get a whole lot easier. So, let’s jump in.
    Don’t squander money on digital marketing.
    When you launch a digital store, your next line of action will be to promote it with digital marketing, right? Wrong. Promoting your e-commerce store, once you get it off the ground, is not the right way to go.
    It’s like proposing a lady on your first date. It’s such a wrong move. You’ll never get a yes! Why? You haven’t spent the time to connect with her: She doesn't know you; she may not like you; and she doesn't trust you.
    Online marketing works just like dating. Starting up anew, the last thing you want is to spend money on marketing before you even start selling your products. Smart, successful startup founders keep it lean, especially at the very beginning.

    They create a minimum viable product first. Then they engage their audience with epic content, slowly building a rapport with their readers before they ask them to buy their product.
    As a startup, you need to focus on sharing great value with your audience. That’s how Darren Rowse built his blog. The Problogger founder started blogging “out of curiosity,” he said but remained firm in providing his audience with great value, teaching and helping them with tips and hacks that make life better. 
    Rowse’s primary goal wasn’t to make money or become a blogging superstar. His primary goal was to help his readers out. That’s how many successful bloggers get to where they are today. They are motivated to serving their audience.
    And in the process of doing that, in their commitment to sharing their knowledge, expertise, and experience with their audience, they build their reputation as well. Suddenly, they become thought leaders, go-to resource people in their industry.
    That’s how you too should build your online business. Not with expensive marketing or black hat SEO, but by building your online reputation, one step at a time.
    Build your online reputation.
    The popular wisdom be to focus on common online marketing campaigns: SEO, link building, and social media marketing among others.
    Sure, these marketing strategies work. An average Facebook user, for example, clicks on eight ads per month, a study by WeAreSocial reveals. But too much obsession with Facebook ads or SEO is bad for you, for your brand, and for your business.
    Here’s why: If you try to run many ads, you’ll end up spending all your money, time, and resources instead of engaging with real humans -- your audiences, readers and prospective customers.
    Again, Google changes every day. As a new online entrepreneur, you should focus more on customer engagement. You can always turn to SEO and other marketing tactics later.

    “But,” you may ask. “How do I effectively engage more with my prospective customers online?” Focus on publishing what I called the Mona Lisa level content. In other words, quality, inspiring, original, and well-written content that hasn’t been written anywhere on the web.
    You write this type of content by, in the words of productivity guru Robin Sharma, “releasing your attachment to outcome.” You stop focusing on how to rank higher on search engine result pages, to secure backlinks, or to generate more leads and sales.
    Instead, you stay committed to a process of constantly coming up with thought-provoking blog ideas, constantly helping your readers with life-changing stories, and constantly publishing an audience-optimized content that solves your reader’s problems. That’s what builds your online reputation as well as expose your brand to your potential customers.
    The recent Google update, Google Rank Brain, buttresses this point. The AI-empowered Rank Brain figures out the searcher’s intent and provides them with accurate results. Successful bloggers grow their business with comprehensive posts that answer their reader’s questions. Let’s examine an example.
    Grow a blog without spending a dime on ads.
    Leo Babauta started blogging in 2007, writing about his personal habits and the changes he was making. But after just five months, the productivity guru made the Technorati Top 1,000, reaching 11,000 subscribers and a million page views a month. Four years later, Time Magazine listed his blog, Zen Habits, as one of the 50 best websites of 2011.
    Crazy, huh? Obviously, Leo Babauta must have spent millions in Facebook ads and Search Engine Marketing (SEM), right? But he didn’t. He just focused on serving his audience with great value.
    “You can put Google Adsense ads on your site from Day 1, and you can launch an amazing ebook in the first month of your blog’s existence,” Babauta penned in one of his blog posts on Zen Habits. “But let me spare you the suspense: you won’t make any money doing that…The missing ingredient is readership, which you can grow by creating amazing and useful content.”
    Year after year, Babauta stayed laser focused and consistent at writing and publishing amazing and useful content on his blog and guest posting on popular blogs. His aim was feeding his readers with content that quench their thirst. Because that’s the only thing that matters.

    Typically, your reader comes to check your blog, not because of your tricky ads or fine landing page, but because of your amazing content. “Your content,” says Babauta, “[is what] will help [your reader] in some way -- by teaching her how to do something, by inspiring or informing or entertaining.”
    The bottom line.
    Facebook ads and SEO are great. But you don’t need them from the start. You need quality content.
    That’s the most important aspect of your business. Of course, in time, you can use SEO and SMM to grow your traffic and revenue, but only after you have built a foundation, when you have grown readership and attracted some fans.
    But for now, focus on building your credibility, your reputation, your authority. That’s how A-list bloggers like Leo Babauta grow their blog; they became authoritative and highly successful in their industry. “It wasn’t until I had 26,000 readers that I got a book deal,” he said. “The readers proved to my publisher that I had something worth saying, and that it was resonating with people.”
    Bring it all together: Commit to creating compelling content, commit to serving your readers, and commit to getting your first 1,000 loyal readers or subscribers.

    a11 = Article.create!(title: "Psychology in Design. Principles Helping to Understand Users", body:"Some people are used to thinking of design as a purely artistic job but there is much more standing behind it. The sense of beauty and inspiration are not enough to create the proficient design. That’s why designers should possess certain knowledge and skills of distinct sciences to do their job right. And it’s not only the art of design, it’s also about various fields of knowledge and practice which help them work efficiently and productively. One of the basic studies helping designers to understand users is psychology. Today, we will figure out what a big part psychology plays in design and what psychological principles are essential to remember during the design process.
      The role of psychology in design
      Today the tendency of user-centered design makes designers reconsider approach to their work and go deeper into the understanding of the target audience. Donald A. Norman in his book “The Design of Everyday Things” defines design as an act of communication, which means having the deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating. In order to get better insight into people’s needs, designers are recommended to bear in mind the psychological principles of human behavior, aspirations and motivations.
      The outcome of the work can be even more positive if a designer applies psychology in the creative process since the science gives the close understanding of the target audience. Psychology knowledge helps to create the design which will make users perform the actions they are expected to such as making a purchase or contacting the team.
      Designers may see psychology as a complicated approach to improving the design and for that reason neglect this part of research and analysis. However, you don’t need to be a Ph.D. in psychology to use it in your work effectively. All you need to consider are the basic principles constantly presented in design. Based on our experience and the conducted research, we’ve defined six effective psychological principles often applied in the design process.
      Gestalt Principles
      This psychological theory is almost 100-year-old but it hasn’t lost its actuality. The word “gestalt” means “unified whole” so the theory explores users’ visual perception of elements in relation to each other. In other words, it shows how people tend to unify the visual elements into groups. The principles, on which users form the groups, include:
      Similarity. If a user sees objects that look somehow similar, they may automatically perceive them as the individual elements of one group. The similarity between elements is usually defined with shape, color, size, texture or value. The similarity gives users the sense of coherence between the design elements.
      Continuation. It is the principle according to which the human eye moves naturally from one object to the other. This often happens through the creation of curved lines allowing the eye to flow with the line.
      Closure. It is a technique based on the human eye’s tendency to see closed shapes. Closure works where an object is incomplete but the user perceives it as a full shape by filling in the missing parts.
      Proximity. When objects are placed in close proximity, the eye perceives them as a group rather than seen individually even if they aren’t similar.
      Figure/Ground. This principle demonstrates the eye’s tendency to separate objects from their background. There are lots of examples of pictures that shows two faces depending on where your eye is focused on the object or background.
      The Gestalt principles confirm in practice that our brain tends to make tricks with us, so designers should consider that fact during the creation process to exclude the possibility of misunderstandings.
      Visceral Reactions
      Have you ever had that feeling when you fall in love with the website after the first second when you’ve opened it? Or maybe an application has made you sick only with the quick glance at it? If yes, then you’ve already known what’s a visceral reaction. This kind of reactions comes from the part of our head called “old brain” responsible for the instincts and it reacts much faster than our consciousness does. Visceral reactions are rooted in our DNA, so they can be easily predicted.
      How do designers use this knowledge? They aim at creating a positive aesthetic impression with the design. It’s not that difficult to guess what looks nice to people and what doesn’t if you know your target audience and their needs. So, the tendency of using the high-resolution beautiful photos or the colorful pictures at landing pages, websites or any other web and mobile products is not accidental.", source_id: s3.id, image_url: "/assets/psych.jpg", url: "https://tubikstudio.com/psychology-in-design-principles-helping-to-understand-users/", author:"Alina Arhipova")

      a13 = Article.create!(title: "UI/UX Design Glossary. Navigation Elements", body:"One of the basic features of product usability is thoughtfully created navigation. It doesn’t matter if the visual performance is creative, stylish, original, catchy and so on and so forth, in case the users don’t know where they are and how they could reach their goals with the website or app. Whatever is the reason that brings users to your digital product, the high level of respecting them means letting them know what is going on and where they are going at every step of interaction with it. Earlier we have already published the Glossary posts with key terms for the topics of usability and web design as well as business terms and abbreviations. This time the perspective will get focused on navigation aspect: let’s check out what parts and elements of the interface are responsible for this vital issue. 
      Navigation
      In its basic meaning, the word navigation names the sphere of human activity responsible for enabling a vehicle to get from one place to the other, controlling and supporting this process. According to etymology dictionary, the term has deep roots and comes from the Latin word navigare “to sail, sail over, go by sea, steer a ship,” which in its turn is based on two words: navis “ship” and agere “to set in motion, drive, drive forward”. So, to navigate is to make possible for someone or something to cover the planned route. This is the foundation from which the numerous meanings of this word took the start and adjusted in many other spheres.
      In terms of user experience design, the concept of navigation is one of the basic notions setting the usability. Navigation, in this case, could be generally defined as the set of actions and techniques guiding users throughout the app or website, enabling them to fulfill their goals and successfully interact with the product. The aspect of efficient navigation has a great impact on setting positive user experience: users start using apps or websites with particular aims and expectations, and that’s designers’ task to set the best and easiest route to solving users’ problems.
      The aspect of helpful and seamless navigation in UI should be thought-out from the early stages of creating the user interface. Users are navigated via interface with a number of interactive elements such buttons, switches, links, tabs, bars, menus, fields and the like, some of which will be described more in details below.
      Here in Tubik we support the workflow in which all the basic navigation issues, such as layout, transitions, elements placement and functionality, are set in the early phase of UX wireframing and then checked with simple prototype to make sure all the important operations and options are clear for users. Neglecting this essential aspect sets high risks that all the other effort on design can be just wasted, so it’s much more user- and client-friendly to start with the basics.
      Menu
      Menu is one of the core navigation elements. It is a graphical control that presents the options of interactions with the interface. Basically, it can be the list of commands – in this case, options will be presented with verbs marking possible actions like, for example, “save”, “delete”, “buy”, “send” etc. Menu can also present the categories along which the content is organized in the given interface, and this can be the high time for using nouns marking them.
      Menus can have different locations in the interface (side menus, header menus, footer menus etc.) and different ways of appearance and interaction (drop-down menus, drop-up menus, sliding menus etc.) Any solution, which designer makes about menu functionality, appearance and placement in general layout, should be based on thoughtful user research, analyzing not only potential wishes and expectations of the target audience but also their tech literacy and possible environments in which the digital product could be used. Well-designed menu can significantly speed up the process of achieving goals and satisfying needs that lay the solid foundation for positive user experience.
      The presented app UI concept shows the type menu applying the effective technique of color marking: when users move to a particular category, the specific background color is used for all the content in it, which forms strong associations and quick perception of the nature and theme of data the user sees.
      CTA
      Behind the widely used abbreviation CTA, designers and content creators mean call to action. This is actually the word of phrase which stimulates users to interact with a product in a way and for the aim it is designed for. CTA elements are the interactive controls which enable users to do the action they are called to. Typical types of such interactive elements in the layout are buttons, tabs, or links.
      In the interfaces of all kinds, CTA elements are the core factor of effective interaction with the product, which plays the crucial role in usability and navigability. When all the path of interaction and transitions is built clearly for users but CTA element is not thought-out, placed or designed well, users can get confused and will need to take additional effort trying to achieve their goals. That sets the high risk for poor conversion rate and general user experience. That’s why this navigation element should draw particularly deep designers attention. In any interface, it should be one of the most prominent and quickly noticeable parts to inform users how the product can be helpful or useful for them.
      As we mentioned in the article with tips on copy content in UI, some call-to-action elements may be represented with icons that don’t require copy using widely and instantly recognized images such as a telephone receiver for making a phone call or the envelope for opening received mail. The app interface presented above shows this case: the button with a receiver is the most prominent interactive element on the screen navigating user to achieving their goals with app quickly, and it doesn’t need the copy to let users understand what action can be done with it.
      However, when the image of an icon is not so obvious or can be misleading, it is more effective to use double scheme, when the icon, button, or link is supported with the copy.", source_id: s3.id, image_url: "/assets/uiux.jpg", url: "https://tubikstudio.com/uiux-design-glossary-navigation-elements/", author:"Marina Yalanska")

      a14 = Article.create!(title: "Orchestrating Experiences", body:"Defining Experience Principles
      If you embrace the recommended collaborative approaches in your sense-making activities, you and your colleagues should build good momentum toward creating better and valuable end-to-end experiences. In fact, the urge to jump into solution mode will be tempting. Take a deep breath: you have a little more work to do. To ensure that your new insights translate into the right actions, you must collectively define what is good and hold one another accountable for aligning with it.
      Good, in this context, means the ideas and solutions that you commit to reflect your customers’ needs and context while achieving organizational objectives. It also means that each touchpoint harmonizes with others as part of an orchestrated system. Defining good, in this way, provides common constraints to reduce arbitrary decisions and nudge everyone in the same direction. How do you align an organization to work collectively toward the same good? Start with some common guidelines called experience principles.
      A Common DNA
      Experience principles are a set of guidelines that an organization commits to and follows from strategy through delivery to produce mutually beneficial and differentiated customer experiences. Experience principles represent the alignment of brand aspirations and customer needs, and they are derived from understanding your customers. In action, they help teams own their part (e.g., a product, touchpoint, or channel) while supporting consistency and continuity in the end-to-end experience. Figure 6.1 presents an example of a set of experience principles.
      Set of experience principles
      Figure 6.1 Example set of experience principles.

      Experience principles are not detailed standards that everyone must obey to the letter. Standards tend to produce a rigid system, which curbs innovation and creativity. In contrast, experience principles inform the many decisions required to define what experiences your product or service should create and how to design for individual, yet connected, moments. They communicate in a few memorable phrases the organizational wisdom for how to meet customers’ needs consistently and effectively. For example, look at the following:
      Paint me a picture.
      Have my back.
      Set my expectations.
      Be one step ahead of me.
      Respect my time.
      Patrick Quattlebaum: Experience Principles vs Design Principles
      Orchestrating experiences is a team sport. Many roles contribute to defining, designing, and delivering products and services that result in customer experiences. For this reason, the label experience &endash; rather than design &endash; reflects the value of principles better that inform and guide the organization. Experience principles are outcome oriented; design principles are process oriented. Everyone should follow and buy into them, not just designers.
      Experience principles are grounded in customer needs, and they keep collaborators focused on the why, what, and how of engaging people through products and services. They keep critical insights and intentions top of mind, such as the following:
      Mental Models: How part of an experience can help people have a better understanding, or how it should conform to their mental model.
      Emotions: How part of an experience should support the customer emotionally, or directly address their motivations.
      Behaviors: How part of an experience should enable someone to do something they set out to do better.
      Target: The characteristics to which an experience should adhere.
      Impact: The outcomes and qualities an experience should engender in the user or customer.
      Chris Risdon: Focusing on Needs to Differentiate
      Many universal or heuristic principles exist to guide design work. There are visual design principles, interaction design principles, user experience principles, and any number of domain principles that can help define the best practices you apply in your design process. These are lessons learned over time that have a broader application and can be relied on consistently to inform your work across even disparate projects.
      It’s important to reinforce that experience principles specific to your customers’ needs provide contextual guidelines for strategy and design decisions. They help everyone focus on what’s appropriate to specific customers with a unique set of needs, and your product or service can differentiate itself by staying true to these principles. Experience principles shouldn’t compete with best practices or universal principles, but they should be honored as critical inputs for ensuring that your organization’s specific value propositions are met.
      Playing Together
      Earlier, we compared channels and touchpoints to instruments and notes played by an orchestra, but in the case of experience principles, it’s more like jazz. While each member of a jazz ensemble is given plenty of room to improvise, all players understand the common context in which they are performing and carefully listen and respond to one another (see Figure 6.2). They know the standards of the genre backward and forward, and this knowledge allows them to be creative individually while collectively playing the same tune.
      Jazz ensembles
      Figure 6.2 Jazz ensembles depend upon a common foundation to inspire improvisation while working together to form a holistic work of art.

      Experience principles provide structure and guidelines that connect collaborators while giving them room to be innovative. As with a time signature, they ensure alignment. Similar to a melody, they provide a foundation that encourages supportive harmony. Like musical style, experience principles provide boundaries for what fits and what doesn’t.
      Experience principles challenge a common issue in organizations: isolated soloists playing their own tune to the detriment of the whole ensemble. While still leaving plenty of room for individual improvisation, they ask a bunch of solo acts to be part of the band. This structure provides a foundation for continuity in the resulting customer journey, but doesn’t overengineer consistency and predictability, which might prevent delight and differentiation. Stressing this balance of designing the whole while distributing effort and ownership is a critical stance to take to engender cross-functional buy-in.
      To get broad acceptance of your experience principles, you must help your colleagues and your leadership see their value. You will need to craft value propositions for your different stakeholders, educate the stakeholders on how to use experience principles, and pilot the experience principles to show how they are used in action. This typically requires crafting specific value propositions and education materials for different stakeholders to gain broad support and adoption. Piloting your experience principals on a project can also help others understand their tactical use. When approaching each stakeholder, consider these common values:
      Defining good: While different channels and media have their specific best practices, experience principles provide a common set of criteria that can be applied across an entire end-to-end experience.
      Decision-making filter: Throughout the process of determining what to do strategically and how to do it tactically, experience principles ensure that customers’ needs and desires are represented in the decision-making process.
      Boundary constraints: Because these constraints represent the alignment of brand aspiration and customer desire, experience principles can filter out ideas or solutions that don’t reinforce this alignment.
      Efficiency: Used consistently, experience principles reduce ambiguity and the resultant churn when determining what concepts should move forward and how to design them well.
      Creativity inspiration: Experience principles are very effective in sparking new ideas with greater confidence that will map back to customer needs.
      Quality control: Through the execution lifecycle, experience principles can be used to critique touchpoint designs (i.e., the parts) to ensure that they align to the greater experience (i.e., the whole).
      Pitching and educating aside, your best bet for creating good experience principles that get adopted is to avoid creating them in a black box. You don’t want to spring your experience principles on your colleagues as if they were commandments from above to follow blindly. Instead, work together to craft a set of principles that everyone can follow energetically.
      Identifying Draft Principles
      Your research into the lives and journeys of customers will produce a large number of insights. These insights are reflective. They capture people’s current experiences &emdash; such as, their met and unmet needs, how they frame the world, and their desired outcomes. To craft useful and appropriate experience principles, you must turn these insights inside out to project what future experiences should be.
      Patrick Quattlebaum:When You Can’t Do Research (Yet)
      If you lack strong customer insights (and the support or time to gather them), it’s still valuable to craft experience principles with your colleagues. The process of creating them provides insight into the various criteria that people are using to make decisions. It also sheds light on what your collaborators believe are the most important customer needs to meet. While not as sound as research-driven principles, your team can align around a set of guidelines to inform and critique your collective work &emdash; and then build the case for gathering insights for creating better experience principles.
      From the Bottom Up
      The leap from insights to experience principles will take several iterations. While you may be able to rattle off a few candidates based on your research, it’s well worth the time to follow a more rigorous approach in which you work from the bottom (individual insights) to the top (a handful of well-crafted principles). Here’s how to get started:
      Reassemble your facilitators and experience mappers, as they are closest to what you learned in your research.
      Go back to the key insights that emerged from your discovery and research. These likely have been packaged in maps, models, research reports, or other artifacts. You can also go back to your raw data if needed.
      Write each key insight on a sticky note. These will be used to spark a first pass at potential principles.
      Set of experience principles
      Figure 6.3 A simple template to generate insight-level principles quickly.
      At this stage, you should coach participants to avoid finding the perfect words or a pithy way to communicate a potential principle. Instead, focus on getting the core lesson learned from the insight and what advice you would give others to guide product or service decisions in the future. Table 6.1 shows a couple of examples of what a good first pass looks like.
      At this stage, don’t be a wordsmith. Work quickly to reframe your insights from something you know (“Most people don’t want to…”) to what should be done to stay true to this insight (“Make it easy for people…”).
      Work your way through all the insights until everyone has a principle for each one.
      From Insights to Draft Principles
      Table 6.1 From Insights to Draft Principles
      Finding Patterns
      You now have a superset of individual principles from which a handful of experience principles will emerge. Your next step is to find the patterns within them. You can use affinity mapping to identify principles that speak to a similar theme or intent. As with any clustering activity, this may take a few iterations until you feel that you have mutually exclusive categories. You can do this in just a few steps:
      Select someone to be a workshop participant to present the principles one by one, explaining the intent behind each one.
      Cycle through the rest of the group, combining like principles and noting where principles conflict with one another. As you cluster, the dialogue the group has is as important as where the principles end up.
      Once things settle down, you and your colleagues can take a first pass at articulating a principle for each cluster. A simple half sheet (8.5” x 4.25” or A5) template can give some structure to this step. Again, don’t get too precious with every word yet. Get the essence down so that you and others can understand and further refine it with the other principles.
      You should end up with several mutually exclusive categories with a draft principle for each.
      Designing Principles as a System
      No experience principle is an island. Each should be understandable and useful on its own, but together your principles should form a system. Your principles should be complementary and reinforcing. They should be able to be applied across channels and throughout your product or service development process. See the following “Experience Principles Refinement Workshop” for tips on how to critique your principles to ensure that they work together as a complete whole.", source_id: s3.id, image_url: "/assets/orchestra.png", url: "https://uxmag.com/articles/orchestrating-experiences", author:"Chris Risdom, Patrick Qauttlebaum")

      The two ride-sharing companies are making their debuts in the equity capital markets, with Lyft going public at the end of last month, and Uber filing its prospectus last week. But Uber is more complicated than its competitor, making valuing the company ahead of its IPO more difficult and open to interpretation.
      That’s because it’s not purely a ride-sharing company and also derives revenue from its food delivery service, Uber Eats, as well as smaller bets such as Uber Freight, Damodaran said. Plus, Uber’s ambitions have been more global than Lyft’s, which has kept its focus on the U.S. and Canada. Uber is also complicated because of major restructuring in the three years leading up to its IPO, as it exited cash-burning investments in China, Southeast Asia, and Russia, leaving the company with losses in the billions.
      But the “good news” is when Damodaran isolated the metrics in the regions where Uber had continuing operations, he found gross billings, net revenues, riders, and rides all increased “strongly” in the last three years.
      Damodaran, an author of multiple books on valuation and corporate finance, arrived at a $61.7 billion in equity value after his analysis, or $54 a share, when adding up Uber’s assets. In another analysis looking at the company based on its riders, he calculated a $58.6 billion valuation, or $51 a share. But, he said depending on the metric used to scale the company’s worth, the overall value can vary by about $80 billion, from $47 billion to $124 billion, depending on the metric scaled to.
      No matter how investors arrive at their valuations, the reality is that “Uber will be priced by the market, and it will be priced relative to Lyft,” he said.
      What is true is that investors have struggled even when it comes to Lyft. After Lyft priced at the high end of its IPO range and surged 21% in its debut, it fell below its IPO price within days and has struggled since. Shares of the ride-sharing company are down another 6% in Monday’s trade.", source_id: s4.id, image_url: "/assets/lyft.jpg", url: "http://fortune.com/2019/04/15/uber-lyft-ipo-valuation-rideshare/", author:"NATASHA RAUSCH")

    Chipmakers were among the big gainers in the technology sector. Advanced Micro Devices rose 2.7%. Qualcomm vaulted 20% following news that the company had settled a bitter legal dispute with Apple. Apple edged up 0.1%.
    Health care stocks lagged the most as traders weighed quarterly earnings from Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group. The results from both companies topped Wall Street forecasts.
    Investors are looking to the latest wave of corporate earnings reports for clues on the health of the global economy and the prospects for company profits this year. Netflix, railroad operator CSX and International Business Machines were scheduled to report quarterly results after the close of regular trading Tuesday.
    Banks kicked off the latest quarterly reporting season last week with mixed results. Analysts expect the first-quarter results for S&P 500 companies overall to be the weakest in nearly three years.
    KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 was up 0.1% as of 3:25 p.m. Eastern Time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 83 points, or 0.3%, to 26,467. The Nasdaq composite added 0.4% and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks picked up 0.3%.
    The benchmark S&P 500 remains within 0.8% of its most recent all-time high on September 20. Stocks have had a torrid start to the year, after the Federal Reserve said it may not raise interest rates at all in 2019.
    Overseas stock indexes rallied on upbeat economic data from China and Germany. Markets in Asia finished higher. European indexes also rose.
    ALL ABOUT EARNINGS: Investors will be poring over corporate earnings reports over the next few weeks. Analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to report a 2.9% drop in earnings per share from a year earlier, which would be the first decline since the spring of 2016. The expected decline is due almost entirely to weaker profit margins.
    THAT'S SETTLED: Qualcomm shares surged following news that the semiconductor maker and Apple have settled their bitter patent dispute. A federal trial was set to begin later this month to determine whether Apple should be required to pay Qualcomm for licensing technology used in iPhones.
    Last month, a federal court jury in San Diego ruled that Apple should pay $31 million in damages to Qualcomm for infringing on patents for technology owned by the chipmaker.

    CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH: UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest health insurance company, reported first-quarter results that exceeded analysts' expectations and raised its estimates for the full year. But cautious comments from management during a conference call with analysts weighed on the stock, which slumped 4%, giving up an early gain.
    MIXED RESULTS: Bank of America was little changed after the nation's second-largest bank reported strong earnings growth, but gave a weak forecast for net interest income, a key performance metric for banks.

    The surprise truce announced Tuesday came just as the former allies turned antagonists were facing off in a federal court trial that was supposed to unfold over the next month in San Diego. The resolution abruptly ended that trial, which also involved Apple's key iPhone suppliers.
    The deal requires Apple to pay Qualcomm an undisclosed amount. It also includes a six-year licensing agreement that likely involves recurring payments to the mobile chip maker.
    Investors reacted as if it were a resounding victory for Qualcomm. The San Diego company's stock soared 23% to close Tuesday at $70.45. Apple shares edged up 2 cents to $199.25.
    Neither Apple nor Qualcomm would comment beyond a brief statement announcing they had resolved their differences. Details about how much Apple and its iPhone suppliers will be paying Qualcomm could emerge in court documents or when the companies announce their latest financial results. Apple is due to report its quarterly results on April 30 while Qualcomm is scheduled to release its numbers on May 1.
    Apple had been seeking at least $1 billion for money that Qualcomm was supposed to rebate as part of an earlier licensing agreement. Apple had begun to have misgivings about that deal as it added more features to its increasingly popular line-up of iPhones.
    Qualcomm was seeking $7 billion for unpaid royalties it contended it was owed for its patented technology in the iPhone. Apple's iPhone suppliers, including Foxconn and Pegatron, wanted another $27 billion from Qualcomm.
    Apple had already lost an earlier battle with Qualcomm last month when a federal court jury in San Diego decided the iPhone maker owed Qualcomm $31 million for infringing on three of its patents.
    Qualcomm still faces other potential fallout from its demands to be paid royalties in addition to the fees it charges for its mobile chips. The Federal Trade Commission has accused the company of using its royalty system to stifle competition in the mobile chip market in another case in which Apple played a central role.

    a18 = Article.create!(title: "Cybersecurity doesn't stop at the federal level — our states need help", body:"This week, Congress reintroduced the State Cyber Resiliency Act, which encourages state and local governments to strengthen their defenses against cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. The bill, originally introduced in 2017, would create and authorize the Department of Homeland Security to run a grant program for states to develop, revise or implement cyber resiliency measures — including efforts to detect, protect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.
    This legislation is good news for local government leaders, businesses and civilians who have been victims of ransomware and other forms of cyberattacks targeted at major cities. Local governments are an attractive target for malicious actors, including the massive cyberattack on the city of Atlanta last year and the recent ransomware attack in Albany, NY. As attacks increase in frequency and sophistication, increased funding at the local level is needed for cyber training and enhancing recruitment and retention efforts, ultimately helping ensure public safety.
    Hyper-local attacks, wide-ranging consequences
    Just because a cyberattack is focused on one city — or even smaller, one sector of infrastructure within a city — does not mean the consequences are minor. In the example of the SamSam ransomware attack in Atlanta, the more than week-long event caused major disruption in five of the city’s 13 local government departments and ultimately cost the city $17 million. Impacting citizens, the system shutdown crippled the court system, limited vital communications involving critical infrastructure requests and forced the Atlanta Police Department to file paper reports. Empowering officials at the state and local level to easily detect and deter such preventable breaches like ransomware could save millions of dollars in damages. 
    Legislation: The first step in the right direction
    According to a 2018 study from Deloitte and the National Association of State Chief Information Officers, nearly 70 percent of states report they lack adequate funding to develop sufficient cybersecurity. Lack of resources is a common challenge faced by the private sector as well. However, private sector CIOs and CISOs often have more flexibility to request and attain additional resources, whereas states are often forced to stay within preapproved budgets. By providing grants, local jurisdictions are more likely to have the financial assets required to invest in the areas or skill sets they need most. 
    In addition to sharing the common issue of insufficient funding, industry and local governments both grapple with a lack of talented cybersecurity professionals. This legislation addresses the existing workforce gap by ensuring states that receive grants will enhance their own recruitment and retention efforts. 
    Strategies for state and local security ramp-up
    While this bill remains on the House and Senate floor, there are some ways that state and local governments can begin securing their systems. The first step should be an audit, allowing key decision-makers to get on the same page about the status of their security. This audit should include secretaries of state, members of the academic community and all cybersecurity staff. Everyone should review the cybersecurity controls and the threat vectors that have been exploited in local systems. Improperly informed stakeholders are the greatest vulnerability.
    U.S. election security needs greater state-by-state alignment. These systems are managed by a hodgepodge of systems that vary from state to state, including paper ballots, electronic screens and Internet voting. Before local elections, midterms and the 2020 presidential election, state officials need to meet with their Boards of Elections and document their end-to-end election process with all of its systems, dependencies and interfaces. 
    This legislation also addresses the resiliency of critical systems such as power utilities, transportation infrastructure and hospitals. Attacks on these systems can cause major problems for local cities and municipalities. These industries deal with a host of sub-contractors, vendors and partners whose cybersecurity readiness, if not up to standards, can create vulnerabilities for everyone involved. To ensure cyber resiliency, states must think about the impact from top to bottom and require all their vendors and IT organizations to conduct security audits. 
    The State Cyber Resiliency Act lends needed support to local governments as they continue to ward off attacks. In the interim, states should begin the cyber hardening process. This includes written guidelines and security standards and educating government employees and local communities through the power of public/private partnerships. Regardless of whether the bill is ultimately passed, the federal government must focus on local and state security: we must have resilient infrastructure at all levels of government — and especially at the state and local level, which are most vulnerable to malicious actors.

    a20 = Article.create!(title: "Data Is The Answer For Communications Service Providers, But What Are The Right Questions?", body:"Tomorrow’s workforce will be defined by more automation, a diverse mix of full-time and contract workers, and rapidly shifting demographics, according to speakers at Oracle’s recent Modern Business Experience conference.
    The most successful employers will be the ones whose leadership teams get on top of these HR trends, the speakers said. Opinions vary on whether automation, expected to become more intelligent and widespread thanks to artificial intelligence, will be a net job creator or destroyer.
    Workforce of the future
    ORACLE
    Speaking at the Oracle conference, KPMG Principal Mike DiClaudio called attention to the firm’s recent global survey of 1,201 HR executives, in which 60% said they think AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates. Conversely, in a KPMG global survey of CEOs, 62% said they think AI will create more jobs than it eliminates.
    Pew Research Center recently surveyed a broader audience, 9,670 consumers in 9 countries, on the same subject. It found that large majorities in each country think that within 50 years it “definitely will happen” or “probably will happen” that robots and computers will do much of the work now done by people. Fewer than half of the respondents to the Pew Research survey think that outcome would lead to new, better-paying jobs, which is counter to the thinking of most CEOs and economists.
    University of Southern California Professor John Boudreau, whose most recent book is Reinventing Jobs: A 4-Step Approach for Applying Automation to Work, co-written with Ravin Jesuthasan, noted the widespread concern that society is reaching “peak human,” much like it reached “peak horse and carriage” more than a century ago. But that’s the wrong way to look at automation, he said.
    CEOs, especially given the shrinking labor pool in most developed countries, may very well turn to automation to redeploy scarce human resources to higher-level work, not so much to cut company labor costs. For example, Accenture automated more than 17,000 transaction-oriented finance jobs starting more than three years ago, using AI and other technologies. But it redeployed most of those people to client-facing financial advisory jobs. “It’s not man versus machine, but man and machine working together,” Boudreau said.
    Employment Is Not ‘Binary’
    Another scenario is that companies will choose to farm out to contractors the X percentage of a job task they can’t automate, said Boudreau, who noted that employment no longer is “binary,” consisting only of direct employers and employees.
    Worker of future
    ORACLE
    Increasingly, he said, the “resources” who do the heavy lifting in the “gig economy” will consist of a mix of full-time employees and trusted third parties: outsourcers/contractors; people “borrowed” from suppliers and partners; people sourced on developer and other specialized talent platforms; volunteers (such as customers who help a company design its products); as well as AI-powered systems.
    Senior executives must lead that entire employment ecosystem, not just the full-timers, Boudreau said. Best Places to Work rankings that don’t factor in feedback from those outside workers are only scratching the surface, he said. Unfortunately, federal and state laws continue to dissuade employers from using contingent workers, treating the latter as an exploited class and ignoring the fact that many of them choose to work independently, Boudreau noted.
    A couple of speakers at Oracle’s Modern Business Experience conference urged employers to manage their contract and other outside workers from their people-oriented human capital management systems (treating them as part of the family, so to speak) and not from their transaction-oriented procurement systems (treating them as mere fill-ins).
    New workforce planning features in the latest release of Oracle Human Capital Management Cloud, for example, make it easier for HR recruiters to filter internal and external candidates by person, job, skills, and other categories to help them craft their company’s optimal workforce.
    Workforce Disruption
    KPMG’s DiClaudio cautioned company leaders to worry about more than potential digital business disruptors. Every employer’s workforce is being disrupted as well, especially by demographics—an aging workforce and, in some cases, a shrinking talent pool. Employers will soon have 80-year-olds (people are retiring later in life) working side-by-side with 20-somethings, he said.
    The HR leaders surveyed by KPMG said that senior management continues to undervalue the need to cultivate the “employee experience” in order to meet the needs of five generations in the workforce. Younger employees, in particular, are drawn to companies more because of the culture and their “personalized experience at work,” DiClaudio said, and less because “we’re number 1” in a given market segment or industry. Using data analytics, CHROs must learn as much about their workers—what they consider to be the optimal employee experience—as CMOs learn about their customers’ buying preferences, he said.
    However, while 50% of the HR leaders surveyed said they strongly believe that a vibrant employee experience is valuable to their companies, and 37% selected it among HR’s top three priorities, only 25% said it’s a top corporate initiative for the next year or two, DiClaudio noted.
    Meantime, almost half of the CEOs KPMG recently surveyed admitted that they struggle with understanding how millennials differ from other generations. Almost half of respondents said that appointing senior leaders who can better relate to millennials is one of their biggest challenges. KPMG’s global HR survey calls out Schneider Electric, which is paying close attention to employee well-being, ongoing communications, and giving more responsibility to younger employees using a “bottom-up” approach as well as “reverse mentoring.”
    Other Key Findings
    Among other key findings in KPMG’s HR study:
    Just 40% of HR leaders said their organization has a digital transformation plan in place. 
    A solid 70% said they recognize the need to transform their workforce, but only 37% said they’re “very confident” about HR's ability to do so. Skill deficiencies (51%) and lack of resources (43%) are considered to be the biggest barriers.

    a21 = Article.create!(title: "Progress in Ocean Salinity Science", body:"How salty are the world’s oceans? Ocean salinity is a key variable of Earth’s water cycle and a key driver of ocean dynamics. The Global Climate Observing System and the Global Ocean Observing System have identified ocean salinity as an essential climate variable: a “must-include” variable in climate models. Recently, through the advent of new observing technologies, research based on salinity measurements has gained prominence within the scientific and operational communities.
    To review recent research progress and discuss future plans, 115 scientists and representatives of operational services met at Sorbonne University in Paris for the fifth Ocean Salinity Science Conference.
    Since the fourth Ocean Salinity Science Conference in 2017, groundbreaking studies have taken advantage of the improved quality and longer time series (50-kilometer resolution, 9 years) of satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements. These studies have also taken advantage of SSS data’s complementarity with in situ and other satellite observations, process studies, and ocean modeling.
    Participants at November’s meeting presented results on observations of the spatiotemporal variability of fresh SSS structures in the Arctic Ocean, the tropical ocean basins, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indonesian Throughflow. Climate events such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole influence both freshwater sources (river plumes and intense precipitation) and freshwater transport in the ocean. Presenters showed how newly observed salinity variability was used to assess earlier model simulations in the Bay of Bengal and to revisit the major freshwater sources governing the water transport through the Indonesian Throughflow.
    Other research presented at the meeting demonstrated the large contribution of eddies to salinity transport, evident in the tropical Pacific Ocean near 10°N and in the Gulf of Maine. Satellite and recent in situ campaigns (Salinity Processes in the Upper-Ocean Regional Study 2) allowed researchers to further quantify the wind’s influence on tropical rainfall penetration into the ocean, suggesting that rainfall, and the ocean water freshening that it causes, is distributed very unevenly within the 50-kilometer pixels in the satellite data.
    Presenters illustrated the potential of satellite SSS assimilation into operational models. In one example, the simulated SSS for 2014–2015 in the northern tropical Pacific improved by as much as 10%. In another study, significant correlation of Niño 3.4 region sea surface temperature anomaly forecasts extended from 4 to 7 months. Other presenters summarized work on long-term trends in such phenomena as water mass and subduction processes, which were further elaborated by new in situ data and modeling studies and related to changes in air-sea fluxes.
    Meeting discussions stressed the need for extended time series of global SSS observations and for pursuing collaborative efforts between the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Aquarius satellite science teams to advance radiative transfer models at the L band frequency range and reduce uncertainties in satellite SSS measurements. They also emphasized collaborations between satellite, in situ, and modeling teams to fully benefit from model assimilation experiments and extend these experiments into operational applications.
    International collaborative efforts between satellite science teams are organized through projects such as the SMOS Pilot Mission Exploitation Platform and the SSS Climate Change Initiative from the European Space Agency and the Salinity Continuity Processing and the Ocean Salinity Science Team from NASA.

    Researchers previously had seen evidence that Titan’s lakes, filled with hydrocarbons like methane and ethane, shrink during the moon’s summer. But a new analysis of data from the defunct Cassini spacecraft offers the first glimpse of lakes completely disappearing off the face of the moon. The discovery of these phantom lakes offers new insight into the only other solar system body known to host a hydrological cycle, researchers report online April 15 in Nature Astronomy.
    Planetary scientist Shannon MacKenzie and colleagues uncovered the disappearing lakes by comparing Cassini observations from two different seasons of Titan’s year, which lasts 29.5 Earth years. In the midst of Titan’s winter in 2006, Cassini’s radar observations indicated that all three lakes were filled with liquid. But when Cassini’s infrared cameras were trained on the lakes in 2013, during the moon’s spring, all three had dried up.
    “The fact that they just do not look like liquids at all to the [infrared] instruments is so weird,” says MacKenzie, of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. These lakes may have been extremely shallow, perhaps just centimeters deep, and evaporated or seeped into the ground as winter turned to spring.
    Not all of Titan’s lakes are so fragile. Planetary scientist Marco Mastrogiuseppe of Caltech and colleagues examined Cassini radar data from 2017 and found that some of the moon’s other lakes may be more than 100 meters deep. The team reported these results in the same issue of Nature Astronomy.
    “We can’t really say from Cassini data” whether the phantom lakes are gone for good or will reemerge next winter, MacKenzie says. To fully understand the phantom lake effect, “what we would really need in the future is some kind of Titan orbiter — something like what we have at Mars with the [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter], or the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on the moon, giving us repeat observations.”", source_id: s6.id, image_url: "/assets/saturn.jpg", url: "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-titan-hydrocarbon-lakes", author:"MARIA TEMMING")

The viral disease has sickened at least 555 people in 20 states, according to numbers released April 15 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    That’s more than the 372 cases reported for all of 2018 — and it’s only April.
    If the outbreak doesn’t get under control, this year could surpass the 2014 high of 667 cases since measles was eliminated from the United States in 2000 (SN Online: 11/30/18). Elimination means that the virus is no longer endemic, or constantly present, though it can still be brought in by overseas travelers. Internationally, outbreaks are ongoing in Ukraine, Israel, the Philippines and Brazil, among other countries.
    Imported disease is the just the spark. What’s fueling measles outbreaks in the United States are pockets of vulnerability in the country, especially within states that have made it easier for parents to skip vaccinating their children. As public health officials grapple with containing the disease, here’s the lowdown on this not-so-conquered virus.
    Why is measles dangerous?
    The first signs of an infection include a fever and cough, followed about four days later by a rash of flat, red spots. There’s no treatment for measles, other than managing symptoms with fever reducers, for example. Those who have been exposed to the virus but aren’t immunized can get vaccinated within 72 hours to protect against the illness.
    Measles can lead to severe medical complications — particularly for babies and young children — including pneumonia or a swelling of the brain that may result in deafness. A decade before the vaccine became available in the United States in 1963, measles sickened around 3 million to 4 million people and killed hundreds each year.  
    “Measles is a bad actor,” says pediatrician and vaccine scientist Peter Hotez at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
    The virus also suppresses the immune system, giving a boost to other infectious diseases. This effect persists for two to three years after a bout of measles, according to a 2015 study published in Science. So getting the measles vaccine is also an effective way of protecting against other infectious diseases, the researchers write.
    Why does measles spread so easily?
    A single person with measles can infect up to 18 others who haven’t been vaccinated. That makes measles more contagious than smallpox or the flu. The measles virus, which invades a person’s throat and nasal cavity, is spread through coughing and sneezing. It can also linger on surfaces or remain in the air for up to two hours, meaning one can enter a room after an infected person left and still be exposed.
    The virus usually has a head start over health officials, because an infected person can begin spreading the virus before being diagnosed, which typically happens once the rash shows up. “There’s this four-day window before you got the rash where you’re infectious,” says Daniel Salmon, who heads the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    To prevent an outbreak of measles, defined as three or more cases, a community needs to maintain herd immunity (SN: 11/11/17, p. 12). That means having enough people vaccinated that the pathogen runs out of new people to infect and transmission dies out. Because measles is so contagious, around 92 to 95 percent of a community must be vaccinated to preserve herd immunity. This protects infants, who aren’t typically vaccinated against measles until their first birthday, as well as children whose immune systems are suppressed due to cancer treatments.
    Why are outbreaks happening?
    The outbreaks this year — there are currently five ongoing in four states — aren’t entirely surprising. Like past outbreaks, they are hitting areas where too few people have been vaccinated to maintain herd immunity.
    A few of the areas that have experienced outbreaks are in states that allow non-medical exemptions for vaccines otherwise required for children to start school.  Of 18 states that have such policies, 12 have seen rising numbers of vaccine exemptions since 2009, Hotez and his colleagues reported in PLOS Medicine in 2018. “Measles tends to be a good biomarker of declines in vaccine coverage,” Hotez says.
    Measles primarily hits those who aren’t vaccinated, but having pockets of low vaccination can also put those who are vaccinated at risk. Of the 1,416 measles cases reported from 2000 to 2015, more than half, or 804, were in people with no history of measles vaccination, Salmon and colleagues reported in 2016 in JAMA. And 199 cases were in people who had received the vaccine, which provides a very high, but not absolute, level of protection.
    Could measles again become endemic in the United States?
    The United States could lose its status as a country in which measles has been eliminated if the virus continues to circulate in an area for at least a year. In that case, measles would be considered endemic again. “That’s the big concern,” Salmon says.
    To prevent that, the population as a whole has to be vaccinated at a level to establish herd immunity everywhere, health officials say.
    Historically, measles season is in late winter to early spring. So “maybe as we move into the summer months, it will start to die down, but it’s unclear” what might happen, Hotez says. “We still have some big epidemics going on.”
    As for whether the United States will go back to having sustained measles transmission, “I don’t know that we’re there yet,” Hotez says. “But we’re moving dangerously close to it.”", source_id: s6.id, image_url: "/assets/measles.jpg", url: "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-measles-outbreaks-not-slowing-down-vaccines", author:"AIMEE CUNNINGHAM")


    a25 = Article.create!(title: "How Ilhan Omar Fits Into Trump’s New Culture War", body:"President Trump isn’t known for following the traditional political playbook. So, it was slightly surprising to see him spending Tax Day talking about … well … taxes.
    But while Mr. Trump’s words may have stayed on message, his political sights were aimed elsewhere: Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.
    That Mr. Trump held his tax event less than 20 miles outside Ms. Omar’s district in Minnesota, a state that narrowly went for Hillary Clinton in 2016, was no accident. Nor were his recent attacks on Ms. Omar, a former state representative who has spent a little more than 27 months in any kind of elected office. 
    Mr. Trump’s appearance Monday in Minnesota, an early salvo in his re-election campaign, highlights a fundamental question he faces as we head into the 2020 race: Will his base be enough this time?
    Rallying conservatives used to revolve around a three-word slogan — “God, guns and gays” — which served as a shorthand for the type of cultural issues that sent voters streaming to the polls.
    Mr. Trump has taken that culture war mantra and supercharged it: “God, guns and gays” has become “immigration, identity and Islamophobia.”
    Mr. Trump has a long history of incendiary comments against Muslims. (This 2017 timeline from The Washington Post details nearly a decade of his statements.) He opened his campaign calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and, since then, has repeatedly cast immigrants as criminals and drug dealers. And from sexual harassment to N.F.L. protests, he has intensified hot-button issues of race and gender by throwing fiery comments into our national debates.
    Some of these stances can be attributed to the president’s personal beliefs and temperament. But there’s also a calculated political strategy at play.

    It’s worth taking a look at some numbers from the 2016 exit polls. When Pennsylvania voters were asked whether minorities are favored in the United States, 31 percent of the electorate — or around 1.9 million voters — agreed. Of those, 1.6 million supported Mr. Trump.
    Pennsylvania, as many of you may remember, went for Mr. Trump by less than 45,000 votes.
    We don’t know how many of those 1.6 million voters flipped to Mr. Trump. What we know is the belief that white people are under attack — which exit polls showed was shared by Trump supporters in Wisconsin and Michigan — has helped animate his support.
    That brings us back to Ms. Omar, a woman at the intersection of all three elements of the new culture war. A refugee from Somalia, she’s a hijab-wearing Muslim and is closely identified with the Democratic Party’s left wing.
    Her comments last month before the Council on American-Islamic Relations led Mr. Trump to post an inflammatory video implying she trivialized the horror of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
    She has also divided members of her own party, having made several statements that repeated historically anti-Semitic tropes. Their responses to Mr. Trump’s video, cataloged here by my colleague Astead Herndon, ranged from fierce to more milquetoast.
    Regardless of the complicated politics surrounding Ms. Omar, though, the freshman congresswoman has a decent shot at re-election. Her Minneapolis district hasn’t voted for a Republican in nearly six decades, and her profile will make it fairly easy for her to raise the kind of money that scares off primary challenges.

    SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
    This week, Congress and the public await the expected release of the Mueller report - or at least what Attorney General William Barr is willing to let them see. What will it say? How much will it be redacted? What will the president tweet about it? Joining me now to discuss this and other political news of the day is national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
    Good morning, Mara.
    MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Sacha.
    PFEIFFER: Mara, when the Mueller report comes out, what are the key elements Congress will be looking for?
    LIASSON: Well, Congress has asked for the report and all the underlying investigative materials. It's - I doubt they'll get everything that they want, so there's going to be a big fight about getting as much material as they're calling for. What we're watching for is what in the report explains why Bob Mueller decided not to make a conclusion about obstruction of justice. We'll be looking and Congress will be looking for what he says about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. He didn't think any of them rose to the legal crime of conspiracy.
    But, you know, Congress is very suspicious of Attorney General William Barr's redactions because last week he repeated the unfounded claim of the president that somehow the Justice Department had spied on Trump and his campaign. It was court-approved surveillance, surveillance approved by a judge. But suspicions are now running high. And the president has tweeted - why should the Democrats in Congress have a right to examine the report? - which is a very basic, simple question with a simple answer. Article 1 says that Congress is a separate and equal branch of government and they have a right to oversee the Justice Department.
    So he has been now, again, calling the report treasonous and saying that it should not be released after previously he said he was fine with it coming out.
    PFEIFFER: Right. And what do you make of that? So why the criticism of it while sort of simultaneously claiming that it largely clears him?
    LIASSON: Well, I think originally, he really wanted to establish a narrative based on Barr's summary of the Mueller report - that it completely exonerated him. Then there were a whole bunch of reports that the summary did not accurately reflect what was in the report and the suggestion that there were a lot of negative things in that report about the president. So he went back to attacking the Mueller report - trying to undermine its credibility - so that when it does come out, he can dismiss it as a partisan witch hunt.
    PFEIFFER: And is that undermining campaign viewed as working?
    LIASSON: Actually not. And what's so interesting about public opinion since Barr's summary was released is that it hasn't really moved at all. Big chunks of the public still believe the president has not been exonerated despite the fact that he's been repeating that he's been totally and completely exonerated. And that's because so much of the American public is so locked in. Seventy percent of Americans are - either strongly disapprove of Donald Trump or strongly approve of him. It's about, you know, 40 who strongly disapprove, about 29 who strongly approve. It shows you that even though he can dominate the media narrative, he can't always win the argument.
    PFEIFFER: Different issue, which is WikiLeaks, which was in the news this week - last week, Trump said, I know nothing about WikiLeaks. That's quite different from when he said, I love WikiLeaks, during the 2016 campaign.
    LIASSON: He actually said that about 141 times, either on tape - on video - or in tweets. And what that shows you is that - how confident he is that he can sit in the Oval Office and say, I don't know anything about WikiLeaks, knowing that every TV station in the world is going to start playing all the tape of him saying how much he loved WikiLeaks during the campaign. It shows you how confident he is that the norms and rules about how presidents should be accurate and truthful do not apply to him.
    PFEIFFER: And presumably, he'll think the same in terms of issues he's expected to run on, like immigration.
    LIASSON: Well, immigration is the No. 1 issue the president ran on in 2016. He's going to run on it again in 2020. And of course, he's been very, very frustrated because more and more families are coming to the border to apply for asylum. And he has offered a bunch of different proposals - closing the border, shutting down the asylum system - and nothing seems to be working. The latest thing that he is proposing is to take these asylum-seekers and send them to sanctuary cities, cities that have decided to limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. Here's what he said.
    (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
    PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they want more people in their sanctuary cities. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. And let's see if they're so happy.
    LIASSON: Yeah. So you can see here, on the one hand, this is a bit of a self-own because immigrants would love to be sent to San Francisco and cities that are welcoming to them. The mayors of those cities have already said, fine, we'll take it. So in his effort to own the libs (ph), he has used policy and families as pawns to punish his political opponents. And that certainly breaks another norm.
    PFEIFFER: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

    a27 = Article.create!(title: "Twitter Is a Big Deal in Politics. That Doesn’t Make It Right.", body:"It’s hard to overstate the role Twitter now plays in politics.
    It’s the president’s favorite form of communication. It’s where public officials make statements, where activists pressure politicians and where reporters announce their latest scoops. It’s where the “conventional wisdom” forms and where our national political narrative is created.
    And it’s totally unrepresentative of America.
    This news probably comes as little surprise to many of you. (I read your notes complaining when we link to too many tweets in this newsletter.)
    But for those who are online political junkies, Twitter can be all-consuming — and, if I may be so bold, perhaps perverting how you think about the 2020 race.
    That’s why I wanted to highlight this excellent analysis published this week by our colleagues Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy.
    “The views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate,” they write. “The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online.”
    Their big takeaway happens to be our second On Politics rule of 2020: Twitter is not real life.
    Now, I must admit my personal position as an avowed Twitter skeptic. My experience during the 2016 election was generally unpleasant: As a woman covering Hillary Clinton, the site sometimes felt like a surreal mix of inside jokes, warmed-over hot takes and snark, interspersed with rape threats.
    But even if your own feed is more hospitable, it’s clear from the data that Twitter’s 280-character window offers a pretty small viewfinder.
    It’s worth diving into some of the specifics of what Nate and Kevin found:
    • Democrats on Twitter are more liberal. Twenty-nine percent of Democrats who post political content online identify as moderate or conservative; 53 percent of other Democrats say they do.

    Stripping Away Lies to Expose a Painter’s Nazi Past
    • Democrats on Twitter are whiter. Seventy-one percent of Democrats who post political content online are white; only 55 percent of other Democrats are. Black voters represent around 20 percent of the Democratic electorate nationwide but just 11 percent of Democrats on social media.
    •Democrats on Twitter are more politically active. Twenty-eight percent of Democrats who post political content online say they’ve attended a protest over the past year; only 7 percent of other Democrats say they have.
    Historically, candidates who’ve built their support largely on the backs of the party’s liberals have lost: Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, Howard Dean and Bernie Sanders come to mind. The candidates who found support among the Democratic establishment — Hillary Clinton, Al Gore and yes, Barack Obama — won the nomination by getting wider backing.
    So what does all this mean for 2020?
    As we’ve written before, there’s no question that the Democratic Party has moved to the left in the Trump era.
    But what this data signals to us is that the issues driving the social media conversation — like Joe Biden’s touchy-feely style or questions around Elizabeth Warren’s ancestry — may not prove to be quite as significant in the real life of the Democratic primary election.

    The tents are 25 square feet, and reach 9 feet at their highest point. Made with 100% organic cotton canvas, they feature 360 degrees of mesh ventilation and a vinyl base to keep rainwater out.
    Catherine, who does most of the interior design and creates many of the luxurious details, covers the vinyl tent base with rustic cowhide and sheepskin area rugs.

Yes, friends, camping season is nearly upon us. 
    With even more transplants flocking to the Front Range and becoming Rocky Mountain weekend warriors, it’s getting tougher than ever to find a private spot to pitch your tent. But fear not—just like most things these days, there’s an app for that. Hipcamp, sort of like Airbnb for both private and public camping spots, just became the first campsite-finding service to integrate real-time federal camping spot availability data into its search service. That means you can navigate to, say, the Rocky Mountain National Park page, and scroll both reservable spots in the park and spots on nearby private land. 
    Those private land options are slightly more expensive than Colorado natives’ old standby—that is, point your Subaru in the direction of the nearest “National Forest” sign and stop when it feels right—but they might come with cushier amenities, ranging from trash receptacles or potable water to straight-up glamping accommodations that families or novice campers will appreciate. Icons in the app indicate what each spot has to offer. Plus, making your reservations in advance guarantee that you won’t be shut out of primetime locations. 
    Hipcamp founder Alyssa Ravasio hopes by opening up more camping spots via private lands, more people will spend their time outdoors (and benefit from the wild’s healing properties). But moreover, they’re betting landowners will preserve their green acres thanks to the financial incentive the app creates to rent tent or trailer spots. By connecting landowners with campers willing to pay for a spot, Hipcamp wagers, they can leverage our favorite weekend pastime—outdoor recreation—to incentivize the thing we need to keep doing it: conservation.
